# Thesis Toolkit

Welcome to this repository! Since you are here, I am assuming that Computer Arithmetic is of interest to you 
(i.e. the art and science of using transistors to do computations, in silicone).

Moreover, I am guessing that you are just as fascinated (as I am) with the paper-and-pencil digital equivalent of
of doing division and (not so often taught nowadays) the square root. This family of algorithms is formally
known as the *digit-recurrence family of algorithms*.

In my M.Sc. thesis, entitled *"Incorporating Multiplication Into Digit-Recurrence Division to Calculate
`sqrt(a*b)`"* ([linked here](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/146514396.pdf)), I have delved into the derivation 
and the hardware implementation of a a fused multiplier and a square rooting unit (just in case, you thought
having a such a machine instruction would change your life, obviously I did!).

Any such unit, while based on the digit-recurrence family of algorithms, need a "guessing table", usually
stored within a ROM (read-only memory) on-board. This ROM is formally called the *"SRT table"*.

Basically, this so-called *SRT Table* serves the same purpose "trial and error" serve when dividing on paper, 
and it looks something like this below:

![SRT Table Contents Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orwa84/thesis/master/figures/SRT-table-contents-colored.png)

In fact, this very SRT table has been generated by the three Mathematica notebooks of this repository, namely:
1. System Parameters Module Supporting Higher-Order Digit Selectors
2. Designer Cell Supporting Higher-Order Digit Selectors
3. Lookup Table Generator Supporting Higher-Order Digit Selectors

## How to use this toolkit

It is very simple, the first thing you need to do is to install Mathematica 8.0 or later. Then open the notebooks and execute them in the same order shown in the numbered list of the previous section.

### First notebook: System Parameters

As the name suggests, this is where you make the design decisions most crucial to the design of your hardware unit, the most important of which is *"bits per high-radix digit"* which is a twisted way of describing the number of binary bits which you synchronous digital
circuit will be able to crunch in every iteration (i.e. with every tick of the clock).

The higher this number is, the faster your circuit is going to be, but the more complex the hardware will need to be (both in terms
of the number of logic gates as well as in terms of the ROM needed to store the SRT table).

"2" is considered a good choice for a practically-sized unit and SRT table.

### Second notebook: Designer Cell

Here, you apply the different optimizations needed to achieve a table of a practical size. Once applied, the *"constants"* are obtained which is all what is needed to generate the actual contents of the SRT table.

### Third notebook: Lookup Table Generator

The table contents are generated by this notebook, along with a C code fragment that permits simulating the hardware unit using the
simulator, which is a part of the same repositry (written in the C programming language).

## Concluding remarks

As far as I know, there is no software currently available in the public domain that permits generating the contents of an SRT table
to be used within of a Digit-Recurrence Divier/Square-Rooting unit that is as powerful, and rigorously verified as this one.

I hope that by using it that you will admire the beauty of this class of algorithms as much as I always did, and that you will go over
the way I explain them in the first part of my thesis. I believe I have done it to the best of a man's ability which is an insignificant
contribution to the knowledge of min kind but a one that I invested in, which has taken a few years of my life.

For any queries, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me.
